This Project aims to be a simple rigid body physics engine/simulator supporting multiple-body simulations of simple polygons.

**BEWARE**: This Project depends on *multiple* external libraries, so the first run of cmake will take a while!

This engine makes use of the following external libraries:

| Library   | Short Description                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GLAD      | OpenGL Loader Library for the function pointers |
| GLFW      | Window management system                        |
| DearImGui | Immediate Mode gui library                      |
